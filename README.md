# [leetcode](https://leetcode.com/scilightener/)
code in go for leetcode problems evrday (i hope)

some problems have nice(or not really lol) explanation along with complexity analysis while some do not

that's bc i started solving problems much earlier than posting them on git~ and one day decided just add all my go-solutions from leetcode to git. it was about ~80 problems and i kinda had not really strong passion to comment each of those
so i just copy-pasted them from leetcode to my pc and then wrote little batch script to commit them all one by one

but!! i will continue providing explanations to the problems i pretend to solve and post here in the future (mostly daily challenges i suppose)

star if you like!!
